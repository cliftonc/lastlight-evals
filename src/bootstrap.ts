 * be the core checkout, so it "just worked". As a separate package our cwd is
 * wherever the user invoked the CLI, so we MUST tell core where its assets live
 * by calling `configureWorkflowAssets({ builtInRoot })` BEFORE any
 * `getWorkflow`/`runWorkflow`. Forget this and workflows silently fail to
